    """MuZero algorithm.
    MuZero is described in the paper:
    `Schrittwieser et al. Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265>`_.

    This is a wrapper that combines two sub algorithm components:

    1. A Muzero-style representation learner.

       The representation learner employs a MCTSModel to train a translation from a raw
       observation to its latent representation. The model is also used to predict the
       reward, values, policy, etc which will be used in the MCTS algorithm.

    2. A MCTS-based policy algorithm. It will perform tree search using the model provided
       by the representation learner to give the final policy on each predict and rollout
       step.

    NOTE: Currently, the MCTS-based policy algorithm is assumed to NOT have any learnable
    parameters. This means that training will only update the parameters of the underlying
    model in the representation learner, and training related hooks for example
    ``train_step()`` and ``preprocess_experience()`` will delegate directly to their
    counterparts in the representation learner. This behavior can be changed if needed in
    the future.

                usually makes the algorithm run faster. However, the result may be
