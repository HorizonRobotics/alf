        Args:
            observation_spec (nested TensorSpec): representing the observations.
            action_spec (nested BoundedTensorSpec): representing the actions; can
                be a mixture of discrete and continuous actions. The number of
                continuous actions can be arbitrary while only one discrete
                action is allowed currently. If it's a mixture, then it must be
                a tuple/list ``(discrete_action_spec, continuous_action_spec)``.
            reward_spec (Callable): a rank-1 or rank-0 tensor spec representing
                the reward(s). For interface compatiblity purpose. Not actually
                used in CausalBcAlgorithm.
            actor_network_cls (Callable): is used to construct the actor network.
                The constructed actor network is a determinstic network and
                will be used to generate continuous actions.
            discriminator_network_cls (Callable): is used to construct the
                discriminator network. The discrimonator is trained in a way
                that is adversarial to the training of the policy, to help with
                the learning of a robust policy. It takes the observation from
                the previous time step to generate the lagrange multiplier
                for the current step.
            actor_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for actor.
            discriminator_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): the optimizer for
                discriminator.
            f_norm_penalty_weight (float): penalty weight for the output of
                the discriminator.
            bc_regulatization_weight (float): weight for the squared prediction
                error based regularization term.
            env (Environment): The environment to interact with. ``env`` is a
                batched environment, which means that it runs multiple simulations
                simultateously. ``env` only needs to be provided to the root
                algorithm.
            config (TrainerConfig): config for training. It only needs to be
                provided to the algorithm which performs ``train_iter()`` by
                itself.
            checkpoint_path (str): the full path to the checkpoint file saved
                by ALF, e.g. "/path_to_experiment/train/algorithm/ckpt-100".
            checkpoint_prefix (str): the prefix to the contents in the checkpoint
                to be loaded.
            debug_summaries (bool): True if debug summaries should be created.
            epsilon_greedy (float): a floating value in [0,1], representing the
                chance of action sampling instead of taking argmax. This can
                help prevent a dead loop in some deterministic environment like
                Breakout. Only used for evaluation. If None, its value is taken
                from ``config.epsilon_greedy`` and then
                ``alf.get_config_value(TrainerConfig.epsilon_greedy)``.
            name (str): The name of this algorithm.
