            reward_spec (TensorSpec): a rank-1 or rank-0 tensor spec representing
                the reward(s).
            env (Environment): The environment to interact with. env is a batched
                environment, which means that it runs multiple simulations
                simultateously. env only needs to be provided to the root
                Algorithm.
            config (TrainerConfig): config for training. config only needs to be
                provided to the algorithm which performs ``train_iter()`` by
                itself.
            actor_network_ctor (Callable): Function to construct the actor network.
                ``actor_network_ctor`` needs to accept ``input_tensor_spec`` and
                ``action_spec`` as its arguments and return an actor network.
                The constructed network will be called with ``forward(observation, state)``.
            value_network_ctor (Callable): Function to construct the value network.
                ``value_network_ctor`` needs to accept ``input_tensor_spec`` as
                its arguments and return a value netwrok. The contructed network
                will be called with ``forward(observation, state)`` and returns
                value tensor for each observation given observation and network
                state.
            loss (None|ActorCriticLoss): an object for calculating loss. If
                None, a default loss of class loss_class will be used.
            loss_class (type): the class of the loss. The signature of its
                constructor: ``loss_class(debug_summaries)``
            optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer for training
            debug_summaries (bool): True if debug summaries should be created.
            name (str): Name of this algorithm.
