    RLAlgorithm provide basic functions and generic interface for rl algorithms.

    The key interface functions are:
    1. predict(): one step of computation of action for evaluation.
    2. rollout(): one step of computation for rollout. rollout() is used for
        collecting experiences during training. Different from `predict`,
        `rollout` may include addtional computations for training.
    3. train_step(): only used for off-policy training.
    4. train_complete(): Complete one training iteration based on the
       information collected from rollout() and/or train_step()

    See OnPolicyAlgorithm and OffPolicyAlgorithm for detail.
