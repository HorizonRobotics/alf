class RLAlgorithm(Algorithm):
    """Abstract base class for RL Algorithms.

    ``RLAlgorithm`` provide basic functions and generic interface for rl algorithms.

    The key interface functions are:

    1. ``predict_step()``: one step of computation of action for evaluation.
    2. ``rollout_step()``: one step of computation for rollout. It is
       used for collecting experiences during training. Different from
       ``predict_step``, ``rollout_step`` may include addtional computations for
       training. For on-policy algorithms (e.g., AC, PPO, etc), the collected
       experiences will be immediately used to update parameters after one
       rollout (multiple rollout steps) is performed; for off-policy algorithms
       (e.g., SAC, DDPG, etc), these collected experiences will be put into a
       replay buffer.
    3. ``train_step()``: only used for off-policy training. The training data are
       sampled from the replay buffer filled by ``rollout_step()``.
    4. ``train_iter()``: perform one iteration of training (rollout [and train]).
       ``train_iter()`` is called ``num_iterations`` times by ``Trainer``.
       We provide a default implementation. Users can choose to implement
       their own ``train_iter()``.
    5. ``update_with_gradient()``: Do one gradient update based on the loss. It is
       used by the default ``train_iter()`` implementation. You can override to
       implement your own ``update_with_gradient()``.
    6. ``calc_loss()``: calculate loss based the ``experience`` and the ``train_info``
       collected from ``rollout_step()`` or ``train_step()``. It is used by the
       default implementation of ``train_iter()``. If you want to use the default
       ``train_iter()``, you need to implement ``calc_loss()``.
    7. ``after_update()``: called by ``train_iter()`` after every call to
       ``update_with_gradient()``, mainly for some postprocessing steps such as
       copying a training model to a target model in SAC or DQN.
    8. ``after_train_iter()``: called by ``train_iter()`` after every call to
       ``train_from_unroll()`` (on-policy training iter) or
       ``train_from_replay_buffer`` (off-policy training iter). It's mainly for
       training additional modules that have their own training logic
       (e.g., on/off-policy, replay buffers, etc). Other things might also be
       possible as long as they should be done once every training iteration.
