    r"""Soft Actor Critic algorithm, described in:

    ::

        Haarnoja et al "Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications", arXiv:1812.05905v2

    There are 3 points different with ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent``:

    1. To reduce computation, here we sample actions only once for calculating
    actor, critic, and alpha loss while ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent``
    samples actions for each loss. This difference has little influence on
    the training performance.

    2. We calculate losses for every sampled steps.
    :math:`(s_t, a_t), (s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})` in sampled transition are used
    to calculate actor, critic and alpha loss while
    ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent`` only uses :math:`(s_t, a_t)` and
    critic loss for :math:`s_{t+1}` is 0. You should handle this carefully,
    it is equivalent to applying a coefficient of 0.5 on the critic loss.

    3. We mask out ``StepType.LAST`` steps when calculating losses but
    ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent`` does not. We believe the correct
    implementation should mask out ``LAST`` steps. And this may make different
    performance on same tasks.

    In addition to continuous actions addressed by the original paper, this
    algorithm also supports discrete actions and a mixture of discrete and
    continuous actions. The networks for computing Q values :math:`Q(s,a)` and
    sampling acitons can be divided into 3 cases according to action types:

    1. Discrete only: a ``QNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. There will
       be no actor network to learn because actions can be directly sampled from
       the Q values: :math:`p(a|s) \propto \exp(\frac{Q(s,a)}{\alpha})`.
    2. Continuous only: a ``CriticNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. An
       ``ActorDistributionNetwork`` for sampling actions will be learned according
       to Q values.
    3. Mixed: a ``QNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. The input of this
       particular ``QNetwork`` (dubbed as "Universal Q Network") is augmented
       with all continuous actions as ``(observation, continuous_action)``,
       while the output heads correspond to discrete actions. So a Q value
       :math:`Q(s, a_{cont}, a_{disc}=k)` is estimated by the :math:`k`-th output
       head of the network given :math:`a_{cont}` as the augmented input to
       :math:`s`. Still only an ``ActorDistributionNetwork`` is needed for first
       sampling continuous actions, and then a discrete action is sampled from Q
       values conditioned on the continuous actions.

    In addition to the entropy regularization described in the SAC paper, we
    also support KL-Divergence regularization if a prior actor is provided.
    In this case, the training objective is:
        :math:`E_\pi(\sum_t \gamma^t(r_t - \alpha D_{\rm KL}(\pi(\cdot)|s_t)||\pi^0(\cdot)|s_t)))`
    where :math:`pi^0` is the prior actor.
