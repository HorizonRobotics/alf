    ::

        Haarnoja et al "Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications", arXiv:1812.05905v2

    There are 3 points different with ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent``:

    1. To reduce computation, here we sample actions only once for calculating
    actor, critic, and alpha loss while ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent``
    samples actions for each loss. This difference has little influence on
    the training performance.

    2. We calculate losses for every sampled steps.
    :math:`(s_t, a_t), (s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})` in sampled transition are used
    to calculate actor, critic and alpha loss while
    ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent`` only uses :math:`(s_t, a_t)` and
    critic loss for :math:`s_{t+1}` is 0. You should handle this carefully,
    it is equivalent to applying a coefficient of 0.5 on the critic loss.

    3. We mask out ``StepType.LAST`` steps when calculating losses but
    ``tf_agents.agents.sac.sac_agent`` does not. We believe the correct
    implementation should mask out ``LAST`` steps. And this may make different
    performance on same tasks.

    In addition to continuous actions addressed by the original paper, this
    algorithm also supports discrete actions and a mixture of discrete and
    continuous actions. The networks for computing Q values :math:`Q(s,a)` and
    sampling acitons can be divided into 3 cases according to action types:

    1. Discrete only: a ``QNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. There will
       be no actor network to learn because actions can be directly sampled from
       the Q values: :math:`p(a|s) \propto \exp(\frac{Q(s,a)}{\alpha})`.
    2. Continuous only: a ``CriticNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. An
       ``ActorDistributionNetwork`` for sampling actions will be learned according
       to Q values.
    3. Mixed: a ``QNetwork`` is used for estimating Q values. The input of this
       particular ``QNetwork`` (dubbed as "Universal Q Network") is augmented
       with all continuous actions as ``(observation, continuous_action)``,
       while the output heads correspond to discrete actions. So a Q value
       :math:`Q(s, a_{cont}, a_{disc}=k)` is estimated by the :math:`k`-th output
       head of the network given :math:`a_{cont}` as the augmented input to
       :math:`s`. Still only an ``ActorDistributionNetwork`` is needed for first
       sampling continuous actions, and then a discrete action is sampled from Q
       values conditioned on the continuous actions. See
       ``alf/docs/notes/sac_with_hybrid_action_types.rst`` for training details.

    In addition to the entropy regularization described in the SAC paper, we
    also support KL-Divergence regularization if a prior actor is provided.
    In this case, the training objective is:
        :math:`E_\pi(\sum_t \gamma^t(r_t - \alpha D_{\rm KL}(\pi(\cdot)|s_t)||\pi^0(\cdot)|s_t)))`
    where :math:`pi^0` is the prior actor.

        Args:
            observation_spec (nested TensorSpec): representing the observations.
            action_spec (nested BoundedTensorSpec): representing the actions; can
                be a mixture of discrete and continuous actions. The number of
                continuous actions can be arbitrary while only one discrete
                action is allowed currently. If it's a mixture, then it must be
                a tuple/list ``(discrete_action_spec, continuous_action_spec)``.
            reward_spec (TensorSpec): a rank-1 or rank-0 tensor spec representing
                the reward(s).
            actor_network_cls (Callable): is used to construct the actor network.
                The constructed actor network will be called
                to sample continuous actions. All of its output specs must be
                continuous. Note that we don't need a discrete actor network
                because a discrete action can simply be sampled from the Q values.
            critic_network_cls (None or Callable): is used to construct critic network.
                for estimating ``Q(s,a)`` given that the action is continuous.  Note that
                if the algorithm is constructed for evaluation or deployment only, the
                critic_network_cls can be set to None and the network will not be
                constructed at all.
            q_network (Callable): is used to construct QNetwork for estimating ``Q(s,a)``
                given that the action is discrete. Its output spec must be consistent with
                the discrete action in ``action_spec``.
            repr_alg_ctor: if provided, it will be called as ``repr_alg_ctor(
                observation_spec, action_spec, reward_spec, config=config)`` to
                construct a representation learning algorithm. The output of the
                representation learning algorithm is used as the input of the
                actor and critic networks. Different from using representation_learner_cls
                in ``Agent``, a target model of the representation learning algorithm
                will be maintained and the representation calculated by the target
                representation learning algorithm will be used for computing
                target critics.
            reward_weights (None|list[float]): this is only used when the reward is
                multidimensional. In that case, the weighted sum of the q values
                is used for training the actor if reward_weights is not None.
                Otherwise, the sum of the q values is used.
            epsilon_greedy (float): a floating value in [0,1], representing the
                chance of action sampling instead of taking argmax. This can
                help prevent a dead loop in some deterministic environment like
                Breakout. Only used for evaluation. If None, its value is taken
                from ``config.epsilon_greedy`` and then
                ``alf.get_config_value(TrainerConfig.epsilon_greedy)``.
            use_entropy_reward (bool): whether to include entropy as reward
            normalize_entropy_reward (bool): if True, normalize entropy reward
                to reduce bias in episodic cases. Only used if
                ``use_entropy_reward==True``.
            calculate_priority (bool): whether to calculate priority. This is
                only useful if priority replay is enabled.
            num_critic_replicas (int): number of critics to be used. Default is 2.
            env (Environment): The environment to interact with. ``env`` is a
                batched environment, which means that it runs multiple simulations
                simultateously. ``env` only needs to be provided to the root
                algorithm.
            config (TrainerConfig): config for training. It only needs to be
                provided to the algorithm which performs ``train_iter()`` by
                itself.
            critic_loss_ctor (None|OneStepTDLoss|MultiStepLoss): a critic loss
                constructor. If ``None``, a default ``OneStepTDLoss`` will be used.
            initial_log_alpha (float): initial value for variable ``log_alpha``.
            max_log_alpha (float|None): if not None, ``log_alpha`` will be
                capped at this value.
            target_entropy (float|Callable|None): If a floating value, it's the
                target average policy entropy, for updating ``alpha``. If a
                callable function, then it will be called on the action spec to
                calculate a target entropy. If ``None``, a default entropy will
                be calculated. For the mixed action type, discrete action and
                continuous action will have separate alphas and target entropies,
                so this argument can be a 2-element list/tuple, where the first
                is for discrete action and the second for continuous action.
            prior_actor_ctor (Callable): If provided, it will be called using
                ``prior_actor_ctor(observation_spec, action_spec, debug_summaries=debug_summaries)``
                to constructor a prior actor. The output of the prior actor is
                the distribution of the next action. Two prior actors are implemented:
                ``alf.algorithms.prior_actor.SameActionPriorActor`` and
                ``alf.algorithms.prior_actor.UniformPriorActor``.
            target_kld_per_dim (float): ``alpha`` is dynamically adjusted so that
                the KLD is about ``target_kld_per_dim * dim``.
            target_update_tau (float): Factor for soft update of the target
                networks.
            target_update_period (int): Period for soft update of the target
                networks.
            parameter_reset_period (int): Period for resetting the value of learnable
                parameters. If negative, no reset is done.
            dqda_clipping (float): when computing the actor loss, clips the
                gradient dqda element-wise between
                ``[-dqda_clipping, dqda_clipping]``. Will not perform clipping if
                ``dqda_clipping == 0``.
            actor_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for actor.
            critic_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for critic.
            alpha_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for alpha.
            debug_summaries (bool): True if debug summaries should be created.
            checkpoint (None|str): a string in the format of "prefix@path",
                where the "prefix" is the multi-step path to the contents in the
                checkpoint to be loaded. "path" is the full path to the checkpoint
                file saved by ALF. Refer to ``Algorithm`` for more details.
            reproduce_locomotion (bool): if True, some slight tweaks are added
                to the original SAC to roughly reproducing its reported results
                on MuJoCo locomotion tasks. These include uniform action sampling
                in the beginning and different masks for actor and critic losses.

        the episode.
