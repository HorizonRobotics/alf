    rollout_step() is called to generate actions for every environment step.
    It also needs to generate necessary information for training.

    update_with_gradient() is called every `unroll_length` steps (specified in
    config.TrainerConfig). All the training information collected at each previous
    rollout_step() are batched and provided as arguments for calc_loss()

        action = sample action from policy_step.action
        collect necessary information and policy_step.info into training_info
