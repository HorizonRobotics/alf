class OnPolicyAlgorithm(RLAlgorithm):
    """
    OnPolicyAlgorithm works with alf.policies.TrainingPolicy to do training
    at the time of policy rollout.

    User needs to implement train_step() and train_complete().

    train_step() is called to generate actions for every environment step.
    It also needs to generate necessary information for training.

    train_complete() is called every `train_interval` steps (specified in
    TrainingPolicy). All the training information collected at each previous
    train_step() are batched and provided as arguments for train_complete().

    The following is the pseudo code to illustrate how OnPolicyAlgoirhtm is used
    by TrainingPolicy:

    ```python
    tape = tf.GradientTape()
    training_info = []

    while training not ends:
        if len(training_info) == train_intervel:
            old_tape = tape
            tape = tf.GradientTape()
        with tape:
            policy_step = train_step(time_step, policy_step.state)
        if len(training_info) == train_intervel:
            with old_tape:
                get batched_training_info from training_info
            train_complete(tape, batched_training_info, time_step, policy_step)
            training_info = []
        action = sample action from policy_step.action
        collect necessary information and policy_step.info into training_info
        time_step = env.step(action)
    ```
