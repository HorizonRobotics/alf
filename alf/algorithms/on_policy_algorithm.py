    """OnPolicyAlgorithm implements the basic on-policy training procedure.

    User needs to implement rollout_step() and calc_loss()

    rollout_step() is called to generate actions for every environment step.
    It also needs to generate necessary information for training.

    update_with_gradient() is called every `unroll_length` steps (specified in
    config.TrainerConfig). All the training information collected at each previous
    rollout_step() are batched and provided as arguments for calc_loss()

    The following is the pseudo code to illustrate how OnPolicyAlgorithm is used:

    ```python
    for _ in range(unroll_length):
        policy_step = rollout_step(time_step, policy_step.state)
        action = sample action from policy_step.action
        collect necessary information and policy_step.info into training_info
        time_step = env.step(action)
    loss = calc_loss(training_info)
    update_with_gradient(loss)
    ```
