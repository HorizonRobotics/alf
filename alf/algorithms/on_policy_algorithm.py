    User needs to implement ``rollout_step()`` and ``calc_loss()``.

    ``rollout_step()`` is called to generate actions for every environment step.
    It also needs to generate necessary information for training.

    ``update_with_gradient()`` is called every ``unroll_length`` steps (specified in
    ``config.TrainerConfig``). All the training information collected by every
    ``rollout_step()`` are batched and provided as arguments for
    ``calc_loss()``.
