    """Exploration by Random Network Distillation, Burda et al. 2019.

    This module generates the intrinsic reward based on the prediction errors of
    randomly generated state embeddings.

    Suppose we have a fixed randomly initialized target network g: s -> e_t and
    a trainable predictor network h: s -> e_p, then the intrinsic reward is

    r = |e_t - e_p|^2

    The reward is expected to be higher for novel states.

        Args:
            encoder_net (EncodingNetwork): a shared network that encodes
                observation to embeddings before being input to `target_net` or
                `predictor_net`; its parameters are not trainable.
            target_net (EncodingNetwork): the random fixed network that generates
                target state embeddings to be fitted.
            predictor_net (EncodingNetwork): the trainable network that predicts
                target embeddings. If fully trained given enough data,
                `predictor_net` will become target_net eventually.
            reward_adapt_speed (float): speed for adaptively normalizing intrinsic
                rewards; if None, no normalizer is used.
            observation_adapt_speed (float): speed for adaptively normalizing
                observations. Only useful if `observation_spec` is not None.
            observation_spec (TensorSpec): the observation tensor spec; used
                for creating an adaptive observation normalizer.
            optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer for training
            clip_value (float): if positive, the rewards will be clipped to
                [-clip_value, clip_value]; only used for reward normalization.
            keep_stacked_frames (int): a non-negative integer indicating how many
                stacked frames we want to keep as the observation. If >0, we only
                keep the last so many frames for RND to make predictions on,
                as suggested by the original paper Burda et al. 2019. For Atari
                games, this argument is usually 1 (with `frame_stacking==4`). If
                it's 0, the observation is unchanged. For other games, the user
                is responsible for setting this value correctly depending on
                how many channels an observation has at each time step.
