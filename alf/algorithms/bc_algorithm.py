    r"""Behavior cloning algorithm.
    Behavior cloning is an offline approach to learn a policy
    :math:`\pi_{\theta}(a|s)`, which is a function that maps an input
    observation :math:`s` to an action :math:`a`. The paramerates (:math:`\theta`)
    of this policy is learned by using the expert action as supervision for
    training, e.g., by maximizing the probability of the expert actions on the
    training data :math:`D`:
    :math:`\max_{\theta} E_{(s,a)~D}\log \pi_{\theta}(a|s)`

            action_spec (nested BoundedTensorSpec): representing the actions; can
                be a mixture of discrete and continuous actions. The number of
                continuous actions can be arbitrary while only one discrete
                action is allowed currently. If it's a mixture, then it must be
                a tuple/list ``(discrete_action_spec, continuous_action_spec)``.
            reward_spec (Callable): a rank-1 or rank-0 tensor spec representing
                the reward(s). For interface compatiblity purpose. Not actually
                used in BcAlgorithm.
            actor_network_cls (Callable): is used to construct the actor network.
                The constructed actor network is a determinstic network and
                will be used to generate continuous actions.
            actor_optimizer (torch.optim.optimizer): The optimizer for actor.
            env (Environment): The environment to interact with. ``env`` is a
                batched environment, which means that it runs multiple simulations
                simultateously. ``env` only needs to be provided to the root
                algorithm.
            config (TrainerConfig): config for training. It only needs to be
                provided to the algorithm which performs ``train_iter()`` by
                itself.
            debug_summaries (bool): True if debug summaries should be created.
            epsilon_greedy (float): a floating value in [0,1], representing the
                chance of action sampling instead of taking argmax. This can
                help prevent a dead loop in some deterministic environment like
                Breakout. Only used for evaluation. If None, its value is taken
                from ``config.epsilon_greedy`` and then
                ``alf.get_config_value(TrainerConfig.epsilon_greedy)``.
