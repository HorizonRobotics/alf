        1) learnable/fixed dynamics module
        2) learnable/fixed reward module
        3) learnable/fixed planner module

        Args:
            action_spec (BoundedTensorSpec): representing the actions.
            dynamics_module_ctor: used to construct the module for learning to
                predict the next feature based on the previous feature and
                action. It should accept input with spec [feature_spec,
                encoded_action_spec] and output a tensor of shape feature_spec.
                For discrete action, encoded_action is an one-hot representation
                of the action. For continuous action, encoded action is same as
                the original action.
            reward_module (RewardEstimationAlgorithm): module for calculating
                the reward, i.e.,  evaluating the reward for a (s, a) pair
            planner_module_ctor:: used to construct the module for generating
                planned action based on specified reward function and dynamics
                function
            reward_spec (TensorSpec): a rank-1 or rank-0 tensor spec representing
                the reward(s).
            particles_per_replica (int): number of particles for each replica
            epsilon_greedy (float): a floating value in [0,1], representing the
                chance of action sampling instead of taking argmax. This can
                help prevent a dead loop in some deterministic environment like
                Breakout. Only used for evaluation. If None, its value is taken
                from ``config.epsilon_greedy`` and then
                ``alf.get_config_value(TrainerConfig.epsilon_greedy)``.

                environment, which means that it runs multiple simulations
                simultateously. env only needs to be provided to the root
                Algorithm.

                provided to the algorithm which performs `train_iter()` by
                itself.
            checkpoint_path (str): the full path to the checkpoint file saved
