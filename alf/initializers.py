    A potential benefit of this intializer is that we can sample from a truncated
    normal distribution: ``scipy.stats.truncnorm(a=-2, b=2, loc=0., scale=1.)``.

    Also incorporates PyTorch's calculation of the recommended gains that taking
    nonlinear activations into account, so that after N layers, the final output
    std (in linear space) will be a constant regardless of N's value (when N is
    large). This auto gain probably won't make much of a difference if the
    network is shallow, as in most RL cases.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        from alf.networks.initializers import variance_scaling_init
        layer = nn.Linear(2, 2)
        variance_scaling_init(layer.weight.data,

        tensor (torch.Tensor): the weights to be initialized
        gain (float): a positive scaling factor for weight std. Different from
            tf's implementation, this number is applied outside of ``math.sqrt``.
            Note that if ``calc_gain_after_activation=True``, this number will be
            an additional gain factor on top of that.
        mode (str): one of "fan_in", "fan_out", and "fan_avg"
        distribution (str): one of "uniform", "untruncated_normal" and
            "truncated_normal". If the latter, the weights will be sampled
            from a normal distribution truncated at ``(-2, 2)``.
        calc_gain_after_activation (bool): whether automatically calculate the
            std gain of applying nonlinearity after this layer. A nonlinear
            activation (e.g., relu) might change std after the transformation,
            so we need to compensate for that. Only used when mode=="fan_in".
        nonlinearity (Callable): any callable activation function
        transposed (bool): a flag indicating if the weight tensor has been
            tranposed (e.g., ``nn.ConvTranspose2d``). In that case, `fan_in` and
            `fan_out` should be swapped.
