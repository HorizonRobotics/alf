    distributed via DDP.

    This is to provide a simple and transparent way to enable DDP for specific
    code logics.

    When the method is wrapped by @data_distributed, the outputs (tensors) of
    this method will have gradient synchronization hooks attached to them. Later
    when those outputs are used in ``backward()`` to compute gradients, the
    hooks will be called to synchronize across all processes. As a result, the
    corresponding parameters receive not only the gradients from this process,
    but also gradients from the other processes. Note that each single process
    will be TRAPPED at the call to the ``backward()`` that involves those output
    tensors, until all processes finished the back propagation and have the
    gradients sync'ed.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        class A(nn.Module):
            # ...
            @data_distributed
            def compute_something(self, input):
              return self._network1(input), self._network2(input)
            # ...

    In the above code, after applying the decorator, the method
    ``compute_something`` will be made data distributed if the following
    conditions are met:

    1. Multiple processes within the same process group creates A's instances
       and calls ``compute_something()`` individually.

    2. All such A instances have ``self._ddp_activated_rank`` set to the correct
       rank of the GPU device that belongs to them.

    Otherwise the method ``compute_something()`` will behave normally.
