        Initialize the layers for decoding a latent vector into an image.

        The user is responsible for calculating the output size given
        `start_decoding_size` and `deconv_layer_params`, and make sure that the
        size will match the expectation. How to calculate the output size:
            if padding=="same", then H = H1 * strides
            if padding=="valid", then H = (H1-1) * strides + HF
        where H = output size, H1 = input size, HF = height of kernel

        Args:
            deconv_layer_params (list[tuple]): a non-empty list of elements
                (num_filters, kernel_size, strides).
            start_decoding_size (int): the initial size we'd like to have for
                the feature map
            start_decoding_filters (int): the initial number of fitlers we'd like
                to have for the feature map. Note that given this value and
                `start_decoding_size`, we always first project an input latent
                vector into a vector of an appropriate length so that it can be
                reshaped into (`start_decoding_size`, `start_decoding_size`,
                `start_decoding_filters`).
            padding (str): "same" or "valid", see tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose
            preprocess_fc_layer_params (tuple[int]): a list of fc layer units.
                These fc layers are used for preprocessing the latent vector before
                transposed convolutions.
            activation_fn (tf.nn.activation): activation for hidden layers
            output_activation_fn (tf.nn.activation): activation for the output
                layer. Usually our image inputs are normalized to [0, 1] or [-1, 1],
                so this function should be tf.nn.sigmoid or tf.nn.tanh.
