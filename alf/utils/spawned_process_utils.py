"""spawned_process_utils.py: Manage global context for subprocesses in ALF.

This module provides functionality to handle global context for subprocesses
spawned by the main ALF process, particularly for creating a `ProcessEnvironment`.
It alters the behavior of ALF functions like `get_env()` in spawned subprocesses
by maintaining and accessing a shared context.
