        """A Class for generating noise from a zero-mean Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

        The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a process that generates temporally
        correlated noise via a random walk with damping. This process describes
        the velocity of a particle undergoing brownian motion in the presence of
        friction. This can be useful for exploration in continuous action
        environments with momentum.

        The temporal update equation is:
        `x_next = (1 - damping) * x + N(0, std_dev)`

        Args:
            state_spec (nested TensorSpec): spec of the state
            damping (float): The rate at which the noise trajectory is damped towards the
                mean. We must have 0 <= damping <= 1, where a value of 0 gives an
                undamped random walk and a value of 1 gives uncorrelated Gaussian noise.
                Hence in most applications a small non-zero value is appropriate.
            stddev (float): Standard deviation of the Gaussian component.
