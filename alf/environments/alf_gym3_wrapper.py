"""Wrapper providing an AlfEnvironment adapter for Gym3 envrionments

Gym3 provides an unified interface for reinforcement leraning environments that
improves upon the gym interface and includes vectorization (i.e. natively
supported batched environments).

Gym3 has a different set of considerations which lead to different design
choices compared to gym. See the following links to learn about those design
choices.

    Although Gym3 provides an official gym wrapper, we decided to not base the
    Alf adapter upon that gym wrapper because:

    1. Performance and resource-wise, relying the natively supported batch
       (vectorized) environments from Gym3 is much more memory-efficient than
       creating a lot of Gym3 instances in subprocesses in batch mode.

    2. Gym3 has a different interface on indicating the last step and first step
       of an episode compared to gym.

    3. Gym3 has different interfaces to rendering and recording from gym.

    4. Gym3 normally do not provide support for resetting the environment.

    In this adapter, all above are considered and patched to achieve
    compatibility with AlfEnvironment.

    Normally you are not expected to call AlfGym3Wrapper directly. Instead the
    ``load()`` functions for various Gym3-based environments are preferred.

    For example, ``suite_procgen.load()`` is used to construct procgen
    environments which themselves are Gym3-based environments.

    NOTE: TimeLimit is currently not applicable to Gym3 environments
    as it does not offer reset() interface.
