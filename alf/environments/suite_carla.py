"""CarlaEnvironment suite.

To use this, there are two ways:

1. Run the code within docker image horizonrobotics/alf:0.0.3-carla
   Both `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_ and
   `Nvidia-Docker2 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_ need to be installed.

2. Install carla:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://carla-releases.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Linux/CARLA_0.9.9.tar.gz
    mkdir carla
    tar zxf CARLA_0.9.9.tar.gz -C carla
    cd carla/Import
    wget https://carla-releases.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Linux/AdditionalMaps_0.9.9.tar.gz
    cd ..
    ./ImportAssert.sh
    easy_install PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.9-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg
    pip install networkx==2.2

                location is with such distance of the goal
            max_collision_penalty (float): the maximum penalty (i.e. negative reward)
                for collision. We don't want the collision penalty to be too large
                if the player cannot even get enough positive moving reward. So the

            stuck_at_collision_distance (float): the car is considerred as being
                stuck at the collision if it is within such distance of the first
                collision location.
            max_red_light_penalty (float): the maximum penalty (i.e. negative reward)

                be too large if the player cannot even get enough positive moving

                the overspeed magnitude will be applied, multiplied by the step
                time (seconds each step of simulation represents) to make the
                penalty invariant to it, and then multiplied by the weight
                of ``overspeed_penalty_weight``.
                A negative value is the same as 0.
            sparse_reward (bool): If False, the distance reward is given at every
                step based on how much it moves along the navigation route. If

            sparse_reward_interval (float): the sparse reward is given after
                approximately every such distance along the route has been driven.
            allow_negative_distance_reward (True): whether to allow negative distance
                reward. If True, the agent will receive positive reward for moving
                ahead along the route, and negative reward for moving back along
                the route. If False, the agent still receives positive reward for
                moving ahead along the route, but will not receive negative reward
                for moving back along the route. Instead, the negative distance
                will be accumulated to the future distance reward. This may ease
                the learning if the right behavior is to temporarily go back along
                the route in order, for examle, to avoid obstacle.
            min_speed (float): unit is m/s. Failure if
                route_length / min_speed + additional_time seconds passed
            additional_time (float): additional time (unit is second) provided
                to the agent in each episode. This is useful especially for the
                episodes with short route_lengths (e.g. < 50m), as it takes
                some time for the car to be able to move (because of initial
                spawning phase with z > 0 and acceleration phase).
            with_gnss_sensor (bool): whether to use ``GnssSensor``.

            data_collection_mode (bool): if True, will use Rule-based agents
                to control the Players. This can be used for purposes such as
                collecting data.
            with_red_light_sensor (bool): whether to use ``RedlightSensor``.
