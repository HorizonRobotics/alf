    is applied after all gym_env_wrappers and before the AlfGymWrapper.

            (env, max_episode_steps) params to enforce a TimeLimit. Usually this
            should be left as the default, alf_wrappers.TimeLimit.
        normalize_action (bool): if True, will scale continuous actions to
            ``[-1, 1]`` to be better used by algorithms that compute entropies.
        clip_action (bool): If True, will clip continuous action to its bound specified
            by ``action_spec``. If ``normalize_action`` is also ``True``, this
            clipping happens after the normalization (i.e., clips to ``[-1, 1]``).
