class GoBoard(object):
    """This implements Go board.

    This class only takes care how the board changes when a valid move is given.
    Other go rules are handled by GoEnvironment

    We maintain the following data and incrementally update them:

    1. _board: the current board of shape [B, H, W]. At each position, 0 means
        it is empty, -1 means a stone of player 0, 1 means a stone of player 1.
        The board is padded with 2 on four sides to make the handling of boundary
        simpler.
    2. _cc_id: the connected component (CC) which each position belongs to. The
        shape is [B, H, W].
    3. _cc_qi: the qi (liberty) of each CC. The shape is [B, max_num_ccs].
    4. _num_ccs: the number of CCs.

    Note that the qi is different from the common definition of qi. For example.
    in the following board, the qi of the connected component "o" is 4 in our data
    structure because position (1, 1) is counted adjacent to (1, 0) and (0, 1) and
    is counted twice towards the qi of "o". While using the common definition of
    qi, the liberty of "o" is 3. We use this different way of calculating qi
    so that code can be simplified.

    The game plays until one of the following events happen:

    1. Both player pass. In this case, the area of each player will be calculated
      and the reward is 1 if player 0 win, -1 if player 1 win. When calculating the
      area, in order for a position to be considered to be owned by a player, it has
      to be either the player's stone or cannot be reached by the opponent's stones.
      With this definition of area, players have to play until all the dead stones
      have been taken out. This shouldn't change how the game is played. This
      is the so called `Tromp-Taylor rules <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Go/Tromp-Taylor_Rules>`_
    2. An invalid move. The opponent will get reward, which means that if player
       0 make an invalid move, the reward is -1. If player 1 make an invalid move,
       the reward is 1. There are two types of invalid moves:
       a. a move to position which is already occupied.
       b. a move which leads to a board exactly same as the previous board.
    3. The total number of moves exceeds ``max_num_moves``. This is considered as
       both passing. ``max_num_moves`` is set to ``2 * height * width``.

    The observation is an ``OrderedDict`` containing three fields:

    1. board: a [batch_size, 1, height, width] int8 Tensor, with 0 indicating empty
       location, -1 indicating a stone of player 0 and 1 indicating a stone of
       player 1
    2. to_play: a [batch_size] int8 Tensor indicating who is going to make the
       next move. Its value is either 0 or 1
    3. prev_action: a [batch_size] int64 Tensor indicating the action taken by
       the previous player. This is pass action for the first step.

    The action is an int64 scalar. If it is smaller than ``height*width``, it means
    to play the stone at (action // width, action % width). If it is equal to
    ``height * width``, it means to pass for this round.
