    """Abstract base class for ALF RL environments.

    Observations and valid actions are described with ``TensorSpec``s, defined in
    the ``specs`` module.

    The ``current_time_step()`` method returns current ``time_step``, resetting the
    environment if necessary.

    The ``step(action)`` method applies the action and returns the new ``time_step``.
    This method will also reset the environment if needed and ignore the action in
    that case.

    The ``reset()`` method returns ``time_step`` that results from an environment
    reset and is guaranteed to have ``step_type=ts.FIRST``.

    The ``reset()`` method is only needed for explicit resets. In general, the
    environment will reset automatically when needed, for example, when no
    episode was started or when it reaches a step after the end of the episode
    (i.e. ``step_type=ts.LAST``).

    If the environment can run multiple steps at the same time and take a batched
    set of actions and return a batched set of observations, it should overwrite
    the property batched to True.

    Example for collecting an episode:

    .. code-block:: python

        env = AlfEnvironment()

        # reset() creates the initial time_step and resets the environment.
        time_step = env.reset()
        while not time_step.is_last():
            action_step = policy.action(time_step)
            time_step = tf_env.step(action_step.action)

    def batched(self):
        """Whether the environment is batched or not.

        If the environment supports batched observations and actions, then overwrite
        this property to True.

        A batched environment takes in a batched set of actions and returns a
        batched set of observations. This means for all numpy arrays in the input
        and output nested structures, the first dimension is the batch size.

        When batched, the left-most dimension is not part of the action_spec
        or the observation_spec and corresponds to the batch dimension.

            A boolean indicating whether the environment is batched or not.
