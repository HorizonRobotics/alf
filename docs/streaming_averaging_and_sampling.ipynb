Suppose the $t$-th sample is $x_t$, a standard way of\n","calculating the average is:\n","$$\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","\\bar{x}_t = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{t}\\right)\\bar{x}_{t-1} + \\frac{1}{t} x_t\n","\\end{equation*}\n","$$\n","\n","If we want to randomly select $k$ samples, the standard way of doing this is the\n","so called [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling).\n","What it does is to keep the $t$-th sample with probability $k/t$ at step $t$ and\n","randomly replacing one of the existing $k$ items.\n","\n","Sometime, we want the average to give higher weight to more recent samples and\n","select recent samples with higher probability. A simple modification to the\n","moving average and reservoir sampling can achieve this.\n","\n","## Streaming average with higher weight for recent samples\n","\n","We only need to change the update rate of the moving average as the following:\n","$$\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\bar{x}_t = \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{t}\\right)\\bar{x}_{t-1} + \\frac{s}{t} x_t\n","\\end{equation}\n","$$\n","\n","Now we analyze how the above scheme assigns weight to different samples. Let\n","$\\bar{x}_t = \\sum_{i=1}^t w_{t,i} x_i$. Now the problem is to find out the values\n","of $w_{t,i}$.  We can see that $w_{t,t} = \\frac{s}{t}$ and\n","$w_{t,i} = (1 - \\frac{s}{t})w_{t-1,i}$ for $t>i$. So we have\n","$$\n","\\begin{array}{ll}\n","w_{t,i} &=& \\frac{s}{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^t (1 - \\frac{s}{j}) \\\\\n","    &=& \\frac{s}{i} \\frac{i+1-s}{i+1} \\cdots \\frac{t-1-s}{t-1}\\frac{t-s}{t} \\\\\n","    &=& s \\frac{(i-s+1)(i-s+2) \\cdots (i-1)}{(t-s+1)(t-s+2)\\cdots t} \\\\\n","    &\\approx& s \\left(\\frac{i}{t}\\right)^{s-1}\n","\\end{array}\n","$$\n","This means that the weight for the $i$-th sample is approximately proportional\n","to $i^{s-1}$.\n","\n","## Streaming sampling with higher probability for recent samples\n","\n","The modification to the reservoir sampling is to keep the $t$-th sample with\n","probability $\\frac{sk}{t}$ instead of $\\frac{k}{t}$. Let $p_{t,i}$ be the probability of\n","the $i$-th sample still being in the reservoir at step $t$. It is clear that for\n","$t\\ge sk$, $p_{t,t} = \\frac{sk}{t}$. The probability of the $i$-th item being in\n","the reservoir at step $t$ is the proability that it is in reservoir\n","at step $t-1$ multiplied with the probility of it not being replaced at step $t$:\n","$p_{t,i} = p_{t-1,i} \\left(1 - \\frac{sk}{t} \\frac{1}{k}\\right) = p_{t-1,i} \\left(1-\\frac{s}{t}\\right)$.\n","With this relationship, we get:\n","$$\n","\\begin{array}{ll}\n","p_{t,i} &=& p_{i,i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^t \\left(1-\\frac{s}{j}\\right) \\\\\n","    &=& \\frac{sk}{i} \\frac{i+1-s}{i+1} \\cdots \\frac{t-1-s}{t-1}\\frac{t-s}{t} \\\\\n","    &=& sk \\frac{(i-s+1)(i-s+2) \\cdots (i-1)}{(t-s+1)(t-s+2)\\cdots t} \\\\\n","    &\\approx& sk \\left(\\frac{i}{t}\\right)^{s-1}\n","\\end{array}\n","$$\n","\n","So we can see that $p_{t,i}$ is approximately proportional to $i^{s-1}$."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
