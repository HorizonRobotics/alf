How to write docstrings (or RST files)
======================================

Basically our docstrings follow the `RST syntax <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_
for hypermedia and the `Google style <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#google-vs-numpy>`_
for documenting function arguments and returns. That means, you can write anything
that's supported by the RST syntax in a docstring, such as tables, figures,
math equations, hyperlinks, ect.

Note that indent and line break are very important when writing RST!

Raw docstring
-------------

Sometimes if there is backslash ``\`` in your docstring, chars will be escaped
when sphinx tries to interpret the string. So if you have latex commands or
backslashes, make sure to append a char 'r' to the front of the docstring. For
example:

.. code-block:: python

    r"""This is a raw docstring.

    The char 'r' should be appended to the front to mark it as raw. No escaping
    will be done.
    """

Math
----

You can use latex syntax to render math equations.

- Inline math uses::

    :math:`\log(3)`

- For a separate paragraph use math block::

    .. math::

        \begin{array}{lr}
            &3 + 5\\
            =&8\\
        \end{array}

  which will generate

  .. math::

    \begin{array}{lr}
        &3 + 5\\
        =&8\\
    \end{array}

Code segment
------------

Sometimes in a docstring we want to refer to the source code. It is best if code
can be visually different from plain text.

- Inline code::

    ``algorithm.train_step()`` or code:`algorithm.train_step()`

  which renders :code:`algorithm.train_step()`.

- Code block::

    .. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            print(x)

    .. code-block:: bash

        cat file > /tmp/output

Class init docstring
--------------------

By default, sphinx will combine the docstring right below a class name with the
docstring of the ``__init__`` function. For example, the two docstrings below

.. code-block:: python

    class Algorithm(object):
        """An algorithm base class."""
        def __init__(self, observation_spec, action_spec):
            """The init function of Algorithm.
            """

will be combined into one description of the class constructor::

    An algorithm base class.
    The init function of Algorithm.

So try to avoid duplicate sentences at the two places.

Arguments
---------

The argument list should always starts with a string "Args:" with a line break,
after which the arguments will be listed and explained::

    Args:
        arg_name1 (arg_type1): description1
        arg_name2 (arg_type2): this is a long description that we have to change
            the line.
        ...
        arg_nameN (arg_typeN): descriptionN

Note that the indents are very important. Argument list should be one level lower
than "Args:". When changing a line for an argument's description, make sure to
indent the rest of the paragraph.

Returns
-------

For any python function, there is only one return. Even we have multiple results
output by a function, it's just a tuple consisting of multiple components. Thus
sphinx only supports rendering one return.

The return list should always starts with a string "Returns:" with a line break,
after which only **one** return type should be documented (no need to *name* the
return)::

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: an output tensor

If the return is not a nest, then the description should just follow the return
type. If, however, we want to document a nest with its different fields, then one
way is to make a bullet list under the return type (notice the indent!)::

    Returns:
        AlgStep:
        - output (nested Tensor): policy action
        - state (nested Tensor): policy state

For an example, see the docstring and rendered result of ``RLAlgorithm.predict_step()``.
